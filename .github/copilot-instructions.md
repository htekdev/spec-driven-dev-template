## ⚠️ CRITICAL: UPDATE PRD.md FIRST - NO EXCEPTIONS ⚠️

**BEFORE doing ANYTHING else, you MUST:**
1. **UPDATE or CREATE PRD.md in the root directory FIRST**
2. **DOCUMENT the change in PRD.md BEFORE touching any code**
3. **NO CODE CHANGES until PRD.md reflects the change**

## PRD Template Reference
Use [docs/prd-template.md](../docs/prd-template.md) as a guide for structuring PRD.md. The template includes:
- Product Overview and Vision
- User Personas
- Feature Requirements
- User Flows
- Non-Functional Requirements
- Technical Specifications
- Release Planning

## Absolute Rules
- ❌ NEVER write code before updating PRD.md
- ❌ NEVER skip the PRD.md update "just this once"
- ❌ NEVER assume the PRD.md is already updated
- ✅ ALWAYS update PRD.md as the FIRST action
- ✅ ALWAYS make PRD.md the source of truth
- ✅ ALWAYS follow the structure in prd-template.md

**Every single request = PRD.md update first. Period.**
